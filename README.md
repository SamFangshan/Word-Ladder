# Word-Ladder
This is an assignment from Stanford CS106X course
The user first specify an input file name. Then the user enters two words from the input file. The program will generate a "word ladder" between the two words, which is a series of words obtained from previous ones by altering one letter at a time. All words in the "word ladder" come from the input file. e.g. user enter "cat" and "dog", then cat -> cot -> dot -> dog.
